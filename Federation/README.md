Welcome to `Federation`, your one-stop solution for robust, flexible, and secure Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET Core. 
It's not just a framework, it's your trusted partner for crafting seamless OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect integrations.

In the interconnected world of web services, managing authentication and authorization can be daunting. 
But not with `Federation`. This library goes beyond the basics, offering a flexible permission policy that tailors security to your application's unique needs.

`Federation` provides comprehensive support for Json Web Tokens (JWT) and external authentication providers. 
It elegantly handles user authentication and consent, ensuring your users' data is secure while providing a seamless login experience.

Authorization is a breeze with `Federation`. With support for Authorization Code Grant with PKCE, Client Credentials Grant, and 
Refresh Token Flow, you have full control over how your users access your application.

But the real magic lies in the `Federation` Identity Model Structure. 
From Identity User, Role, and Client to Identity Resource, Scope, Directory, Group, Permission, and Tenant, `Federation` provides a fine-grained, systematic approach to managing identities. 
This means you can focus on what you do best: building amazing applications.
