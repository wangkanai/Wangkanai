Welcome to `EntityFramework`, your ultimate companion for making the most out of Entity Framework in ASP.NET Core. 
It's more than just a project - it's a productivity powerhouse designed to simplify your development workflow.

Dealing with data is an essential part of any application, and `EntityFramework` is here to make that task easier. 
Our project provides a suite of extra features and helpers that augment Entity Framework, enabling you to write less code, reduce errors, and increase your overall productivity.

`EntityFramework` goes beyond basic data handling. 
We understand the complexities of working with databases, which is why we have packed this project with utilities that make it easier to manage relationships, perform efficient queries, and much more.
