## Responsive: Bridging the Gap Between Devices and Experiences

Welcome to `Responsive`, a powerful ASP.NET Core middleware library that dynamically tailors your application's view to
the requesting client device.
It's not just about resizing and rearranging elements - it's about creating unique, device-specific experiences that
engage users.

In an era where users can access your application from a myriad of devices, creating a one-size-fits-all UI is no longer
feasible.
Yet, managing different versions of the same page can be daunting and inefficient.
That's where `Responsive` steps in, bridging the gap between various devices and delivering optimized experiences
straight from the server side.

The magic of `Responsive` lies in its ability to discern the type of device making the request, be it a desktop, tablet,
or mobile phone.
With this information at hand, Responsive routes the request to a view specifically tailored for that device.
The result? An application that feels right at home on any device, providing a seamless user experience.

But `Responsive` doesn't stop there! Recognizing that user preference is paramount, this library incorporates a feature
that allows users to choose their preferred view, giving them control and enhancing their overall experience.
